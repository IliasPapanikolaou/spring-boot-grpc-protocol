/*
A unique number needs to be assigned to each attribute, called the tag.
The protocol buffer uses this tag to represent the attribute, instead of using the attribute name.
So unlike JSON, where we'd pass the attribute name firstName every single time,
the protocol buffer will use the number 1 to represent firstName.
The response payload definition is similar to the request.

Note that we can use the same tag across multiple message types

The numbers are called 'Tags'
